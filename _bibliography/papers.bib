abstract = {Many energy performance analysis methodologies assign buildings a descriptive label that represents their main activity, often known as the primary space usage (PSU). This attribute comes from the intent of the design team based on assumptions of how the majority of the spaces in the building will be used. In reality, the way a building's occupants actually use the spaces can be different than what was intended. With the recent growth of hourly electricity meter data from the built environment, there is the opportunity to create unsupervised methods to analyze electricity consumption behavior to understand whether the PSU assigned is accurate. Misclassification or oversimplification of the use of the building is possible using these labels when applied to simulation inputs or benchmarking processes. To work towards accurate characterization of a building's utilization, we propose a modular methodology for identifying potentially mislabeled buildings using distance-based clustering analysis based on hourly electricity consumption data. This method seeks to segment buildings according to their daily behavior and predict which ones are misfits according to their assigned PSU label. The process assigns a flag indicating potential mixed-use or a misclassified PSU label based on uncharacteristic electricity use behavior. Our results on two public data sets, from the Building Data Genome (BDG) Project and Washington DC (DGS), with 507 and 322 buildings respectively, show that 26{\%} and 33{\%} of these buildings are potentially mislabelled based on their load shape behavior. Such information provides a more realistic insight into their true consumption characteristics, enabling more accurate simulation scenarios. Applications of this process and a discussion of limitations and reproducibility are included.},

abstract = {Occupancy estimation is very useful for a wide range of smart build-ing applications including energy efficiency, safety, and security. In this demonstration, we present a novel solution called FORK, which uses a Kinect depth sensor for estimating occupancy in real-time. Unlike other camera-based solutions, FORK is much less privacy invasive (even if the sensor is compromised) and it does not require a powerful machine like a Microsoft XBOX or an Intel {\textregistered} Core TM i7 processor to process the depth data. Our system performs the entire depth data processing on a cheaper and lower-power ARM processor, in real-time. In order to do that, FORK uses a novel light-weight human model by leveraging anthropometric properties of human bodies for detecting individuals. We will show how FORK detects, tracks, and counts occupants accurately in real-time.},

abstract = {One of the most extensively used methods in documenting and preserving archaeological sites is 3D acquisition and reconstruction. However, despite the benefits that this method holds, price and portability continue to be an issue for its application in low-income countries. This work presents a characterization (error measurement and working conditions) of the Microsoft Kinect sensor and a complete methodology of data acquisition, registration and 3D reconstruction of archaeological walls based on the application of computer vision algorithms and image processing. Consecutive range and color images are obtained by a Kinect for XBOX 360. Then, the range images are converted into point clouds and separated in groups. Based on their respective color images, they are aligned using the Speeded Up Robust Features algorithm and refined with an Iterative Closest Point approach. Finally, an accumulative registration using ICP approach is applied to all point clouds in a combinatory fashion. Subsequently, a 3D mesh is formed and compared with other 3D reconstructions based on photogrammetry and 3D laser scanners. Experiments show errors of 6.3 millimeters in accuracy and 2.2 millimeters in precision. Accuracy errors of 4.79 and 1.49 centimeters are obtained when compared to a photogrammetry-based reconstruction and a laser scanner model, respectively. This methodology provides relatively high accuracy metrics and proposes an inexpensive alternative for 3D scanning that surpasses other devices in terms of price and time needed for data acquisition.},

abstract = {Total Station has been one of the most common acquisition devices for achieving maps through topographic survey. Nowadays, Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) and Photogrammetry are commonly used to generate accurate meshes. In addition, commercial products such as Kinect offer low cost technology to acquire point-cloud information. The present paper aims to measure the accuracy of these digital modelling techniques by employing elevation contour maps, surface deviations and distance measurements. For this purpose, a 450 m sector of the Qhapaq Nan located in Lima-Peru, was selected as a case of study. A camera-enabled drone was used for acquiring pictures to obtain a high-resolution photogrammetric model. Subsequently, a 3D survey of the monument was conducted with a time-of-flight laser scanner. Contour elevation lines where extracted from TLS, Photogrammetry and Total Station models at the same depths in order to determine the precision of photogrammetry and laser scanner reconstructions. In addition, geometrical comparisons were performed among the 3D models above mentioned and the Kinect sensor. The comparison showed that TLS is the most accurate tool for 3D reconstruction. However, Photogrammetry and Kinect provided errors of less than one centimeter in accuracy.},

The AC power meter, provided as open hardware, is designed using the same micro controller as the Arduino UNO 1 with an In-system Programming (ISP) interface, thus allowing the user to change the firmware to match their particular use case using Arduino libraries or standard C language. The suggested design is compatible with the Raspberry Pi 3 2 , making it a suitable real-time measurement accessory for the single board computer. The platform features an 8 channel simultaneous sampling Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) which allows a high fidelity sampling without time offsets. Depend-ing on how the user decides to combine current transformers (CTs) and AC-AC voltage adapters for the input channels, circuit breakers or appliances can be measured in either one phase or three phases.},

abstract = {This study describes a human-building interaction framework called the SDE Learning Trail, a mobile app that is currently deployed at the SDE4 building-the new Net Zero Energy Building (NZEB) at the National University of Singapore (NUS). This framework enables building occupants and visitors to learn about the well and green features of the new NZEB while facilitating collection of environmental comfort feedback in a simple and intuitive way. Within just three months, 1163 feedback responses of thermal, visual and aural comfort were obtained. A total of 616 participants have contributed to the study till date, with 79 participants who provided five or more instances of feedback. This data set provides new opportunities for understanding occupant comfort behavior through supervised and unsupervised data-driven methods. This paper demonstrates how occupants can be clustered into comfort personality types that could be used as a foundation for prediction and recommendation systems that use real-time occupant behavior instead of rigid comfort models. We provide an overview of the application methodology and initial results in the SDE4 building.},
